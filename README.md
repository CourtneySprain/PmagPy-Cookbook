Project Information

This documentation is updated from that in the book entitled Essentials of Paleomagnetism by Tauxe et al., (2010). This cookbook was designed and written by Lisa Tauxe as a companion website to the the book Essentials of Paleomagnetism, 2nd Web Edition. Chapter references to this companion book are, for example, “Essentials Chapter X”.

The files in the cookbook were first added to this Github repository on January 14, 2014 and at that point represented a version of the cookbook that was last updated on May 24, 2013. While the vast majority of the content was written and generated by Lisa Tauxe there are many chefs who contributed to the work, in particular, the MagIC Database Team (Cathy Constable, Anthony Koppers, Rupert Minnett, Nick Jarboe, and Ron Shaar).
